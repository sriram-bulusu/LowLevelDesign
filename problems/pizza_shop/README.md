# Design a Pizza Shop

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the pizzas from a list of default menu pizzas or can users build their own pizzas? Ans: Users can order from the menu or build their own pizzas
2. Are the pizzas all flat rate or does the price change based on pizza? What about the built pizzas? Ans: Each menu pizza has it's own price. For built pizzas, we can calculate the price based on the price of each individual topping. 
3. Does the platform support takeout or delivery? Do we need to track that? Ans: No we don't need to worry about that. Just dine-in
